### Self Check
Use this section to check your work. On _these_ projects, your goal isn't to attain 100% pixel perfection, but to use the tools you've learned to get relatively close to the desired output.

- There is 8px between the edge of the card and its content (the blue sections).
It's 5px 16px;  But clsoe enough.
- There is an 8px gap between each of the blue sections inside the card.
It's 7px, again close enough.
- The title of the card uses a 16px font. 18px.
- There are 8px between the title text and the edge of the title section. 20px
padding, A little bit off I guess.
- The content section has 16px space on the top and bottom, and 8px on either side. 20px 10px comparing to 16px 8px, it's close enough.
- Everything inside the `.button-container` section is centered, and there is 8px padding. Yes, it's center, using flexbox. 10px 20px.
- The Big Button is centered on its own line. Yes. It's a block element now.
- The Big Button has 24px space on the sides, and 8px on top and bottom. 
It's padding is 10px 20px So 8px 24px, close enough.
