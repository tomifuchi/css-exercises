# An entire page!

Flexbox is useful for laying out entire pages as well as the smaller components we've already been working with. For this exercise, we're leaving you with a little more work to do, with some things you may not have encountered yet. It's perfectly acceptable to google things you're unsure of!

### Hints
- You may want to search something like `CSS remove list bullets`.  We've done this for you in previous examples, but not here. Yay learning.
- Finding out how to style links in CSS might help you get rid of that pesky underline decoration...
- We've added `height: 100vh` to the `body`... this makes the body exactly the same height as the viewport. To stick the footer to the bottom you will need to use flex and change the direction to column.

## Desired Outcome

### Self Check

- The header is at the top of the page, the footer is at the bottom, and they stay in place if you resize your screen. Yes, they stayed the same.
- The header and footer have padding. Yes it's about 15px
- The links in the header and footer are pushed to either side. Yes, using 
space-between to do it.
- There is space between the links in the header and footer. Yes, using gaps.
- The footer has a light gray background (`#eeeeee`). Eh, mine is #ccc but it's
close enough.
- The logo, input and buttons are centered in the screen. Absolutely, column and using align items to do so.
- The buttons have an appropriate amount of padding. Of course  10px of paddings
- There is space between the logo, input and buttons. They do now, using gap
propertise with 7px.
