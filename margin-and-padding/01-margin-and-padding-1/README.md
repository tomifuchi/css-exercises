# Margin and Padding practice

For this first exercise, simply edit the `style.css` file so that the divs look like the image below. Only edit the CSS where instructed in the file.  You should only have to change the values of the margin and padding for this exercise. You should not have to add or remove properties in the CSS, or touch the HTML.

### Self-check 
Use this section to check your work. On _these_ projects, your goal isn't to attain 100% pixel perfection, but to use the tools you've learned to get relatively close to the desired output.

By looking at css file, and inspecting tool of the web browser. I got these
answers:
- Div One and Div Three have 32px between their text and border. I got 30px so,
close enough I guess.
- Div One has 12px between it and any other element on the page. Ehm...You mean margin ? If so then I got 30px
- There is a 48px gap between Div Two and Div Three. I got 50px, close enough.
- Div Three is aligned to the right. Yep, looks like it
- Div Three's alignment is achieved using `margin` (and not float, flexbox, etc.). Yes, margin-left
